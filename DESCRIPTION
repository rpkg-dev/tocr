Title: TOC Generation for (R) Markdown Documents
Version: 0.1.9001
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Salim",
           family = "BrÃ¼ggemann",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "salim-b@pm.me",
           comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0002-5329-5987"))
Description: tocr allows to automatically add/update/remove
    a table of contents (TOC) to/from an (R) Markdown document. Internal
    links are compatible with HTML "anchors", commonly referred to as "#
    links" pointing to HTML fragment identifiers generated by sites like
    GitHub or GitLab when rendering the Markdown. tocr supports backlinks
    to ease navigation within large documents as well as other options to
    tailor the TOC to specific needs. It can also convert a wide range of
    similar auto-generated TOC formats to its own one.
