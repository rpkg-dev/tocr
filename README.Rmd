RmdTOC is an R package that allows to automatically add a table of contents (TOC) to (R) Markdown documents. Internal links are [compatible](vignettes/intro.html#toc-markdown_flavor) with anchors generated by sites like GitHub.

## Features

...

## Details

RmdTOC uses the following two [HTML comments](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_comment.asp) to mark the begin and end of an auto-generated TOC:

```html
<!-- TOC BEGIN -- leave this comment untouched to allow auto update -->
```

```html
<!-- TOC END -- leave this comment untouched to allow auto update -->
```

RmdTOC's `add_toc()` supports the comment format of other similar software like [doctoc](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc). If you stumble upon software-generated Markdown TOCs which aren't recognized by `add_toc()`, feel free to [file an issue](http://gitlab.com/salim_b/RmdTOC/issues) or even add support for it on your own and submit a [merge request](https://gitlab.com/salim_b/RmdTOC/merge_requests).

## Installation
```{r child = file_path_installation_notice_dev_version}
```

## Development
```{r child = file_path_literate_programming_notice}
```
