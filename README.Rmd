**tocr** is an R package that allows to automatically add/update/remove a table of contents (TOC) to/from an (R) Markdown document. Internal links are [compatible](vignettes/intro.html#toc-markdown_flavor) with HTML "anchors" (commonly referred to as _# links_ pointing to [HTML fragment identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier)) generated by sites like GitHub or GitLab when rendering the Markdown.

## Features

## Details

tocr uses the following two [HTML comments](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_comment.asp) to mark the beginning and end of an auto-generated TOC:

```html
<!-- TOC BEGIN -- leave this comment untouched to allow auto update -->
```

```html
<!-- TOC END -- leave this comment untouched to allow auto update -->
```

`tocr::add_toc()` supports the comment format of [other similar software](#see-also) like [doctoc](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc). If you stumble upon software-generated Markdown TOCs which aren't recognized by `tocr::add_toc()`, feel free to [file an issue](http://gitlab.com/salim_b/r/pkgs/tocr/issues) or even add support for it on your own and submit a [merge request](https://gitlab.com/salim_b/r/pkgs/tocr/merge_requests).

## Installation

## Development

### Literate Programming
```{r, literate-programming-snippet, child = path_notice_lp}
