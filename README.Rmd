`r pal::desc_value("Description")`

## Details

tocr uses the following two [HTML comments](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_comment.asp) to mark the beginning and end of an auto-generated TOC:

```html
<!-- TOC BEGIN -- leave this comment untouched to allow auto update -->
```

```html
<!-- TOC END -- leave this comment untouched to allow auto update -->
```

`tocr::add_toc()` supports the comment format of [other similar software](#see-also) like [doctoc](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc). If you stumble upon
software-generated Markdown TOCs which aren't recognized by `tocr::add_toc()`, feel free to [file an issue](http://gitlab.com/salim_b/r/pkgs/tocr/issues) or
even add support for it on your own and submit a [merge request](https://gitlab.com/salim_b/r/pkgs/tocr/merge_requests).

## Installation
```{r, install-snippet-dev, child = pkgsnippets::rmd_snippet_path("installation-notice_dev-version_gitlab.Rmd")}
```

## Development

### R Markdown format

```

```{r, coding-style-snippet, child = pkgsnippets::rmd_snippet_path("coding-style-notice.Rmd")}
```
