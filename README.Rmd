tocr is an R package that allows to automatically add a table of contents (TOC) to (R) Markdown documents. Internal links are [compatible](vignettes/intro.html#toc-markdown_flavor) with HTML "anchors" (commonly referred to as _# links_ pointing to [HTML fragment identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier)) generated by sites like GitHub or GitLab when rendering the Markdown.

## Features

## Details

tocr uses the following two [HTML comments](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_comment.asp) to mark the beginning and end of an auto-generated TOC:

```html
<!-- TOC BEGIN -- leave this comment untouched to allow auto update -->
```

```html
<!-- TOC END -- leave this comment untouched to allow auto update -->
```

tocr's `add_toc()` supports the comment format of other similar software like [doctoc](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc). If you stumble upon software-generated Markdown TOCs which aren't recognized by `add_toc()`, feel free to [file an issue](http://gitlab.com/salim_b/tocr/issues) or even add support for it on your own and submit a [merge request](https://gitlab.com/salim_b/tocr/merge_requests).

## Installation
```{r, install-snippet, child = file_path_installation_notice_dev_version}
```

## Development
```{r, development-snippet, child = file_path_literate_programming_notice}
```
