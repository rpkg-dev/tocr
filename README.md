# RmdTOC: Add a table of contents (TOC) to an (R) Markdown file

RmdTOC is an R package that allows to automatically add a table of contents (TOC) to (R) Markdown documents. Internal links are [compatible](vignettes/intro.html#toc-markdown_flavor) with anchors generated by sites like GitHub.

## Features

## Details

RmdTOC uses the following two [HTML comments](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_comment.asp) to mark the begin and end of an auto-generated TOC:

```html
<!-- TOC BEGIN -- leave this comment untouched to allow auto update -->
```

```html
<!-- TOC END -- leave this comment untouched to allow auto update -->
```

RmdTOC's `add_toc()` supports the comment format of other similar software like [doctoc](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc). If you stumble upon software-generated Markdown TOCs which aren't recognized by `add_toc()`, feel free to [file an issue](http://gitlab.com/salim_b/RmdTOC/issues) or even add support for it on your own and submit a [merge request](https://gitlab.com/salim_b/RmdTOC/merge_requests).

## Installation

To install the latest development version of `RmdTOC`, run the following in R:

```r
if ( !("remotes" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) )
{
  install.packages(pkgs = "remotes",
                   repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org/")
}

remotes::install_git(url = "http://gitlab.com/salim_b/RmdTOC.git")
```

## Development

This package is written using literate programming techniques proposed by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/rlp/). This means all the `-GEN.R` suffixed R source code found under [`R/`](R/) is generated from their respective R Markdown counterparts found under [`Rmd/`](Rmd/) as instructed by the [`Makefile`](Makefile). Always make changes to the `.Rmd` files – not the `.R` files – and then run `make && Rscript -e "devtools::install('.', keep_source = TRUE)"` from the root of this repository to regenerate the R source code. Make sure that [`make`](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Make)[^make-windoof] is available on your system and that the R packages `knitr` and `rmarkdown` are up to date.


[^make-windoof]: On Windows, `make` is included in [Rtools](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/). On macOS, you have to install the [Xcode command line tools](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10301513/7196903).
